# example_code_from_education

```generating_multiple_vector``` and ```simple_nb_code_1gram``` are from the Bachelor's project on using simple models to predict languages and dialects when the data/corpus and target space is big

```template_model``` is from an independent research project I did the semester before the Master's thesis (autumn 2023) on predicting MBTI personality types based on tweets. This uses Huggingface models.

```intro_seq_v2``` is a notebook I made during the Master's Thesis to set up the incoming data to a specific format a model would use. This is the MaChamp model (https://github.com/machamp-nlp/machamp) developed by the research group I worked with, which uses configs and commandline for running.


These were the scripts I still had access to from the solo projects I did in NLP.
